- q: What is Cloud™ Lifetime?
  a: This is how long your Cloud™ and data are available. Clouds™ don't live forever, and neither will your data. Unless, of course, you put it in a new Cloud™.

- q: How does my data get stored in the Cloud™?
  a: There are currently three ways to upload to our Cloud™. The first is through our Web client or our upcoming mobile app. The second and third methods are our physical item upload. You can upload your items via either a helium balloon or a Soviet rocket, both of which are available to customers with the Storm plan.  (We suggest the rocket; it's a <em>lot</em> more fun.)

- q: What is the Frying-Pan package?
  a: For all paying customers we ship our signature handmade frying pans, to enable our Lightning-Fast uploads.

- q: What happens if there's a storm, or a hurricane or tornado?
  a: When adverse weather is forecasted, we make extra backups until it subsides.

- q: Where's my Cloud™?
  a: Once you sign up, your Cloud™ is automatically put in the Stratosphere, moving around constanly. Our primary data centers are in Seattle, Portland, London, and Glasgow, where Clouds™ have a weird tendency to gather for what we believe are raging parties.
