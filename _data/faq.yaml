- q: How do I actually transfer data to my Cloud™?
  a: You can sync your files and data to your Cloud™ through your favorite Web browser, or with our upcoming mobile app.  If you're a developer, see <a href="#">here</a>.

- q: How does my data get stored in the Cloud™?
  a: We're planning a series of entries on our technical blog that describe this exact thing.  In a nutshell, we encode your data using a variant of established meteorological methods.

- q: How do you make sure your Clouds™ won't lose my data?
  a: There's a <em>lot</em> of redundancy.  If your cloud is dispersed by the wind or penetrated by an airplane, that's okay; your data is safe in a nearby Cloud™!  This process is entirely transparent to you, of course.

- q: What happens if there's a storm, or a hurricane or tornado?
  a: Nothing.  That's the awesome part; your Cloud™ doesn't go away.

- q: Where's my Cloud™?
  a: Because of how our infrastructure works, we can't give you a simple answer to this one.  Our primary data centers are in Seattle, Portland, London, and Glasgow, if that's what you're asking.
